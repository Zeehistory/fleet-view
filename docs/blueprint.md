# **App Name**: STL View Master

## Core Features:

- File Upload: Allow users to upload STL files from their local computer.
- Model Display: Display the uploaded STL model in a 3D space using Three.js.
- Model Rotation: Implement controls for rotating the 3D model using mouse or touch events.
- Model Zoom: Implement zoom functionality using mouse wheel or pinch gestures.
- UI Elements: Add a simple, clean user interface for file uploading and model interaction.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: White or light gray for the background to highlight the 3D model.
- Secondary color: Dark gray for the user interface elements (buttons, labels, etc.).
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Clean and minimalist layout to focus on the 3D model.
- Simple, clear icons for zoom, rotate, and other controls.

## Original User Request:
create an stl viewer; allow the user to upload a file and then view it; i should be able to rotate the model, and zoom in: 

2. Choosing a Graphics Library or Platform:
Graphics Libraries:
OpenGL and DirectX are powerful low-level APIs for rendering graphics. 
Three.js is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies 3D rendering on the web. 
Game Engines/Platforms:
Unity and Unreal Engine offer pre-built 3D rendering capabilities and tools for creating interactive experiences. 
Coppercube is a web-based platform for creating 3D viewers and configurators. 
Mattercraft allows you to create 3D and AR model viewers with interactive controls. 
3. Implementing the Viewer:
Loading the 3D Model:
Use a library or code to read the 3D file and extract the data. 
This data includes vertices, faces, textures, and materials. 
Setting up the Scene:
Create a 3D scene with a camera, lights, and the loaded 3D model. 
You may also want to add a skybox or environment to the scene. 
Rendering the Model:
Use the graphics library to render the 3D model on the screen. 
This involves calculating the position of each vertex, drawing the faces, and applying textures and materials. 
Interactivity:
Implement user controls to rotate, zoom, and pan the camera. 
You may also want to add options to view the model in different lighting conditions or with different materials. 
4. Testing and Debugging:
Thoroughly test your viewer with different 3D model formats and file types.
Debug any issues that arise with rendering or loading the models.
Optimize the viewer for performance and memory usage. 
Tools and Resources:
Libraries:
tiny_obj_loader, Assimp, and other libraries can help with parsing 3D file formats. 
Tutorials and Documentation:
Three.js documentation offers tutorials and examples for web-based 3D rendering. 
Unity documentation provides resources for game development and 3D model viewers. 
Coppercube documentation guides you through creating 3D viewers and configurators.
